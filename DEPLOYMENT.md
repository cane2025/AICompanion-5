# Deployment Configuration Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the deployment fixes applied to resolve the Node.js runtime deployment issue.

## Applied Fixes

### 1. Node.js Runtime Configuration
- **Status**: ✅ Verified Node.js 20.19.3 is installed and operational
- **NPM Version**: 10.8.2 confirmed available
- **Runtime Test**: Successfully builds and creates production bundle

### 2. Deployment Configuration Files

#### `replit.toml`
- Specifies Node.js 20 as the runtime environment
- Configures build and deployment commands
- Sets production environment variables

#### `Dockerfile`
- Container-based deployment configuration
- Multi-stage build process with Node.js 20 Alpine
- Production-optimized dependency installation

#### `deploy.json`
- General deployment metadata
- Engine specifications (Node.js ≥18.0.0, npm ≥8.0.0)
- Build and start command definitions

#### `build.sh`
- Automated build script for deployment
- Dependency installation and verification
- Production build testing

### 3. Build Process Verification
The deployment build process has been tested and confirmed working:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm ci

# Build application (frontend + backend)
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

### 4. Build Output Structure
```
dist/
├── index.js          # Bundled Node.js server (47KB)
└── public/           # Static frontend assets
    ├── index.html    # Main HTML file
    └── assets/       # CSS, JS, and image assets
```

## Deployment Commands

### For Replit Deployments
```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

### For Container Deployments
```bash
# Build Docker container
docker build -t healthcare-app .

# Run container
docker run -p 5000:5000 healthcare-app
```

### Manual Build Process
```bash
# Run the automated build script
./build.sh
```

## Environment Requirements

- **Node.js**: 20.x (verified: 20.19.3)
- **npm**: 8.x+ (verified: 10.8.2)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (configured via DATABASE_URL)
- **Port**: 5000 (configurable via PORT environment variable)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Port already in use**: Ensure no other services are running on port 5000
2. **Missing dependencies**: Run `npm ci` to install all required packages
3. **Build failures**: Check that TypeScript compilation succeeds before building

### Verification Steps
1. Check Node.js version: `node --version`
2. Verify build process: `npm run build`
3. Test production server: `npm start`

## Notes
- The application successfully builds a production-ready bundle
- All Node.js runtime dependencies are properly configured
- Database connectivity is maintained through environment variables
- Static assets are served correctly through Express
