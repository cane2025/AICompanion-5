## ðŸ”„ Deployment Steps

### 1. **Code Deployment**
```bash
# Merge feature branch to main (squash merge)
git checkout main
git merge --squash feat/care-gfp-delete-ui
git commit -m "feat: multi-item CRUD for Care/GFP + WeeklyDocs 2.0

- Add robust multi-item CRUD with nanoid, versioning, timestamps

- Update frontend with CarePlanList and ImplementationPlanList
- Add standardized query keys and API helpers
- Update documentation and dev scripts

BREAKING CHANGE: Data structure changed to arrays with nanoid IDs"
```

### 2. **Tag Release**
```bash
git tag -a v2.0.0 -m "Release v2.0.0: Multi-item CRUD + WeeklyDocs 2.0"
git push origin v2.0.0
```

### 3. **Deploy to Production**
- [ ] Deploy code changes to production server
- [ ] Verify application starts without errors
- [ ] Check application logs for any startup issues

### 4. **Data Migration**
```bash
# Run dry-run first
npm run migrate:prod:dry-run

# If dry-run successful, run actual migration
npm run migrate:prod
```

### 5. **Post-Deployment Verification**
```bash
# Run production smoke tests
./scripts/smoke-prod.sh

# Verify all endpoints return correct status codes
curl -s http://your-prod-url/api/health | jq
```

## ðŸ§¯ Rollback Plan

### Immediate Rollback (if critical issues)
```bash
# 1. Stop application

cp server/data/store.backup.YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM.json server/data/store.json

# 3. Revert code to previous version
git checkout v1.x.x
git tag -a v1.x.x+1 -m "Rollback to v1.x.x due to critical issues"

# 4. Restart application
```

### Gradual Rollback (if non-critical issues)
- [ ] Disable new features via feature flags (if implemented)
- [ ] Monitor error rates and user feedback
- [ ] Plan fix and re-deploy
